# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I used an object-oriented approach in that I created classes for things that seemed like objects.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I read a lot of documentation on typescript and looked at previous people's questions and threads on stackoverflow.com when I needed help with something.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> All of my free time at school this past week went into this. I thought about it in the shower, in my bed, and ended up working on it during another class (sorry to that professor).


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> Maybe an 8? It was really difficult because I had to deal with the learning syntax of a language I do not know well, and getting caught between things I know I do not know and things I do not know that I do not know.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> So it seemed like there should have been a way to add members to organizations, but the current interface does not include that. So I ended up changing the interface to add 2 additional menus for that. I understand the unclear requirements reflecting the real-world, but many students probably will not realize they should ask about that.
